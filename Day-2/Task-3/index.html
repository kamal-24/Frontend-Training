      “The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more
      progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its
      existence.”

    <h2>Nikola Tesla's contibution towards science:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1889 - </strong>In 1889 Tesla invented Tesla coil which proved
        the existence of electomagentic raditaion.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1890 - </strong>He attempted to develop a wireless lighting
        based on near-field inductive conducted a series of public
        demonstrations.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1892 to 1894- </strong>Served as vice-president of America
        Institute of Electrical Engineers curently(IEEE).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1895 - </strong>In 1895 Edward Dean Adams collabrated with Sir
        Tesla and started Nikola Tesla Company.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1896 - </strong>X-ray experimentation : Tesla said he could feel
        a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place
        where it passed out. In comparing these particles with projected by his
        "electric gun," Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force ... will
        travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in
        concentrations".
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1898 - </strong>Radio-Control : In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a
        boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed
        "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison
        Square Garden.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1898-? - </strong>Wireless power : From the 1890s through 1906,
        Tesla spent a great deal of his time on a series of projects trying to
        develop the transmission of electricity without wires. It was an
        expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been
        demonstrating in wireless lighting.To create a way to transmit worldwide
        communications.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Eidetic memory - </strong>Tesla read many works, memorizing
        complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.He was a
        polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English,
        French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.
